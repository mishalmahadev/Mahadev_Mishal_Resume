\section{Projects}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textbf{ Spotter Snake}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item E-yantra robotics
		competition by IITB.
		\textbf{(Aug 2017-Mar 2018)}
		\item Designing and building of a biomorphic robot that
		resembles a snake capable of traversing different
		terrains and can be used to detect rodents present in
		warehouse.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Braille watch}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ignited Innovators of India by COE Pune and EATON. \textbf{(Nov 2017-Mar 2018)}
		\item The project is based on braille language used by blind people to read the text. We have used a microcontroller MSP430G2253 and RTC module to actuate the linear actuator which will display time in braille format when requested by user
	\end{itemize}
	\item Line Following Based Multipurpose System for Hospitals:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item India Innovation challenge design contest by Texas Instruments and IIM Bangalore.\textbf{(Quarter final ongoing)}
		\item Our idea is to make a clone of sweeper robot and delivery robot to perform multiple tasks semi-autonomously and autonomously.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ Anti-pilferage and anti-adulteration system for fuel road tankers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Smart India Hackathon 2017\textbf{(Stage to ongoing)}
		\item System addresses the problem of pilferage and adulteration of fuel tanks en-route from terminals to retail outlets by continuous monitoring of location, level, pressure and temperature parameters with cloud connectivity also ensuring emergency management.
	\end{itemize}
	\item\textbf{ Waveform generator}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item TY B-Tech Mini project\textbf{(Jul 2017-Dec 2017)}
		\item Designed a system to generate waveform using PWM and also using DAC module of LPC2148 microcontroller
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
